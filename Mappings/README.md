# Psychiatry WG Mappings

Welcome to the Psychiatry WG Mappings directory! This space is devoted to showcasing the exploratory efforts undertaken by the Psychiatry Working Group. Our primary focus is on evaluating how effectively the OMOP vocabularies can harmonize neuropsychiatric data. Through these mappings, we aim to:
* **Identify Semantic Gaps**: Pinpoint missing concepts that could enhance the comprehensiveness of the OMOP model.
* **Improve Hierarchical Structures**: Suggest and implement improvements to the existing vocabulary hierarchies.
* **Develop a Conceptual Model**: Create a robust framework for incorporating neuropsychiatric assessment instruments into the OMOP Common Data Model (CDM).

## Current Focus Areas
Our team processed data from several sources to ensure a comprehensive initial analysis. These sources include:

* **TOP100 Real-World Assessment Instruments**: A selection of the most commonly used instruments in real-world settings, providing a broad base for our mapping efforts.
* **Arab Scales**: This mapping set encompasses over 400 unique scales from the Arab Scales collection, each meticulously mapped to enhance the representation and integration of mental health assessments
* **HPO Neuropsychiatry Section**: Utilizing the Human Phenotype Ontology to align neuropsychiatric phenotypes with clinical data.
* **ICD10CM Psychiatry Chapter**: Mapping from the International Classification of Diseases, focusing specifically on psychiatric classifications.
* **Item-Level Mapping of Real-World Assessment Instruments**: Detailed mappings at the item level to ensure precise data representation.

## Collaboration and Contribution
We welcome contributions and feedback from all members of the community. If you have experience in neuropsychiatry, OMOP, or related fields, and are interested in contributing to the development of these mappings, please feel free to submit pull requests or raise issues for discussion.
