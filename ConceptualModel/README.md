# The Conceptual Model for Neuropsychiatric Assessment Tools Integration in OHDSI/OMOP

## Rationale
The integration of Neuropsychiatric Assessment Tools (NPATs) into the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model (CDM) addresses a critical need within the domain of mental health research and care. The neuropsychiatric field, characterized by its diverse assessment instruments and scales, presents unique challenges for data harmonization. These challenges stem from the inherent complexity of mental health disorders, the variability of assessment tools used across different studies and clinical settings, and the subjective nature of many diagnostic processes. As a result, the harmonization and standardization of neuropsychiatric data have become paramount to improving the reliability and comparability of research findings and clinical outcomes.
Neuropsychiatric assessments, with their wide range of scales and measures, are essential for diagnosing conditions, monitoring treatment progress, and conducting large-scale epidemiological studies. However, the lack of a unified approach to storing and interpreting this data limits the ability to perform cross-study comparisons, meta-analyses, and the development of global data standards. The OMOP CDM, with its structured approach to healthcare data, offers a promising framework for overcoming these obstacles. By integrating NPATs into the OMOP CDM, researchers and clinicians can leverage a standardized data model to enhance the accessibility, analysis, and interpretation of neuropsychiatric data.

## Objectives 
The ultimate goal of integrating NPATs into the OMOP framework is to enhance the utility of neuropsychiatric assessments in observational research and clinical studies. Through this initiative, the OHDSI community aims to address the challenges of data variability and fragmentation, paving the way for more robust research findings and improved clinical outcomes in the field of mental health.

This integration seeks to achieve several key objectives:

* **Standardization of Neuropsychiatric Data**: Develop a standardized vocabulary and classification system for NPATs to be applied across different studies and healthcare settings, thereby facilitating data comparability and meta-analytic research efforts.
* **Enhanced Data Utilization**: Enable more effective use of NPAT data in clinical decision-making and research by providing a structured format for data entry, storage, and analysis.
* **Interdisciplinary Collaboration**: Foster collaboration among neurologists, psychiatrists, psychologists, researchers, data scientists, and other stakeholders by creating a common language and framework for neuropsychiatric data. 
* **Global Impact on Mental Health Research**: By standardizing neuropsychiatric assessment data, the OMOP model aims to contribute to a global understanding of mental health disorders, enhancing the ability to identify trends, risk factors, and effective treatments on a broader scale.

## Methods

### 1. Literature Review and Expert Collaboration
The development of a comprehensive Neuropsychiatric Assessment Tools (NPAT) vocabulary required a meticulous methodological approach, beginning with an extensive literature review and expert collaboration in the fields of psychiatry and neurology. This foundational step involved analyzing a wide range of scientific articles, clinical reports, and existing assessment tools to identify essential terms, classifications, and concepts crucial to neuropsychiatric assessments. The objective was to capture the full spectrum of terminology used across different contexts, ensuring the vocabulary's relevance and applicability.
Expert collaboration was integral to refining the NPAT vocabulary. Professionals from diverse backgrounds, including clinicians, researchers, and data scientists, provided insights into the practical aspects of neuropsychiatric assessments, nuances of different tools, and implications of specific terms and classifications.
To construct a comprehensive NPAT lexicon, the initiative leveraged authoritative resources, including the Thesaurus of Psychological Index Terms, the Collection of Psychological Scales from Arabpsychology.com, and the Human Phenotype Ontology. These resources provided a structured foundational framework enriched with standardized terminologies and classifications.
Furthermore, input from experts within the OHDSI community and beyond contributed significantly to expanding and refining the vocabulary. Real-world datasets and case studies shared by working group members offered practical examples of NPAT usage, highlighting the need for certain terms and classifications not covered by existing OHDSI standardized terminology.

### 2. Hierarchical Analysis
The classification of NPATs begins with hierarchical analysis, which methodically examines the relationships and structures among different assessment tools and their components. This approach is critical for unraveling the intricate web of connections across NPATs, arranging them into a clear hierarchy that reflects both their functional roles and theoretical underpinnings. Through segmenting NPATs into distinct categories and levels, we gain insights into their interplay and the broader context of neuropsychiatric evaluations. This segmentation is pivotal for pinpointing redundancies and voids in the current system, laying the groundwork for a more systematic organization and access to assessment data.

Central to this analysis is the "Observable Entity" semantic class from SNOMED CT that clarifies how assessment tools are organized and interlinked. This principle utilizes SNOMED CT’s extensive ontology to systematically categorize each tool and component based on observable characteristics in the neuropsychiatric domain, such as **symptoms**, **behaviors**, or **cognitive functions**. The Observable Entity concept refines the classification's granularity and accuracy, aiding in the identification of nuanced distinctions and potential areas for enhancement in the classification system.

### 3. Semantic Constructs and Mapping
Following the hierarchical analysis, the development of semantic constructs becomes a pivotal phase in the classification of NPATs. This involves creating well-defined semantic representations for the key elements within the neuropsychiatric domain. These constructs serve as conceptual anchors, capturing the essence of the phenomena being assessed and ensuring consistency in terminology across different tools and studies. The semantic constructs are mapped to the hierarchical structure identified in the previous step, thereby enhancing data clarity and interpretability.

### 4. Classification Development
A meticulous approach is crucial for developing NPAT classification within OHDSI/OMOP. This involves hierarchical organization guided by the Observable Entity principle and establishing semantic constructs for clearer data, reflecting best practices in the neuropsychiatric domain. Key steps in this process include:

For instance, versions of the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) exist in Spanish, Chinese, Arabic, and many other languages, allowing for the assessment of depression symptoms across diverse cultural and linguistic groups.

#### Expanding the Hierarchical Analysis:
---
* **Detailed Categorization Based on Assessment Objectives**: NPATs can be categorized according to their primary objectives, such as diagnosing specific conditions, measuring symptom severity, or monitoring treatment response. This layer of classification helps users select the most appropriate tool for their research or clinical needs.
     * **Diagnosing Specific Conditions**: numerous NPATs are explicitly created to diagnose mental health conditions, employing a variety of approaches and methodologies tailored to specific disorders. For instance, the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HDRS) provides a structured interview process to diagnose depression by evaluating the severity of symptoms over a range of domains. Another example, the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS), is utilized to identify and measure the severity of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).
    * **Measuring Symptom Severity**: other NPATs focus on quantifying the severity of symptoms associated with neuropsychiatric conditions. The Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), for example, assesses the intensity of anxiety symptoms, providing valuable data on the patient's current state.
    * **Monitoring Treatment Response**: some NPATs are specifically utilized to monitor changes in patient conditions in response to treatment interventions. The Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) is often used in clinical trials and practice to assess changes in depression symptoms following treatment.
* **Incorporation of Dimensionality in Assessments**: recognizing that many neuropsychiatric conditions are multifaceted, NPATs should be classified not only by the conditions they assess but also by the dimensions of those conditions they measure:
   * **Cognitive Dimension**: tools like the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) or the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS) are exemplary in evaluating cognitive functions, assessing aspects such as memory, attention, executive functions, and language abilities. These assessments are crucial in understanding cognitive impairments associated with various neuropsychiatric conditions, including dementia, traumatic brain injuries, and schizophrenia.
   * **Emotional Dimension**: instruments such as the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) or the Anxiety and Depression Detector (ADD) focus on the emotional aspects of mental health, quantifying the intensity of depressive or anxious symptoms. By measuring the emotional dimension, clinicians can better understand the emotional dysregulation that accompanies disorders like depression and anxiety, informing more targeted therapeutic interventions.
   * **Behavioral Dimension**: the Conners' Rating Scales (CRS) or the Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale (ASRS) exemplify tools designed to assess behavioral dimensions, identifying patterns such as hyperactivity, impulsivity, and attentional difficulties. These tools are invaluable in diagnosing conditions characterized by behavioral dysregulation, including Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and conduct disorders, thereby guiding appropriate behavioral interventions and strategies.
   * **Neurological Dimension**: These assessments, such as Trail Making Test (TMT) or Boston Naming Test (BNT), evaluate neurological functions such as processing speed, visuospatial abilities, and executive functioning. By assessing the neurological dimension, clinicians can identify impairments related to neurological conditions like stroke, traumatic brain injury, and neurodegenerative diseases.
* **Temporal and Contextual Dynamics**: classifying NPATs based on the temporal phase of assessment (e.g., baseline, follow-up) and the context (e.g., clinical, research) can provide critical insights into their optimal use cases.
    * **Temporal Aspect**: NPATs are often designed to capture data at specific moments in a patient's treatment journey. For instance, baseline assessments might include tools like the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) to gauge initial severity levels of depression before intervention. Follow-up assessments, on the other hand, might employ the same tool or others like the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) to monitor changes and treatment efficacy over time. This temporal classification acknowledges the dynamic nature of neuropsychiatric conditions and the need for assessments that can accurately reflect changes across different treatment stages. 
    * **Contextual Settings**: the utility and relevance of NPATs can vary significantly depending on the setting in which they are used. In clinical contexts, tools may be selected for their diagnostic precision, ease of use, and ability to inform treatment decisions, such as the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) for cognitive impairment. Research settings, conversely, may prioritize NPATs with strong psychometric properties for validity and reliability across diverse populations, like the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) for studying depression in large cohorts. Additionally, some tools are specifically designed or adapted for use in specialized populations or care settings, such as the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) for diagnosing autism spectrum disorders in both clinical and research environments.

#### Refining Semantic Constructs and Mapping:
---
* **Standardization of Terminology**: develop a standardized glossary of terms used across NPATs, focusing on achieving consensus on definitions for key concepts (such as 'anxiety', 'depression', 'cognitive impairment', etc.). This effort includes distinguishing between scales that measure similar constructs but differ in methodology or focus.
* **Semantic Interoperability**: ensure that the NPAT vocabulary is interoperable with other medical and psychological terminologies used within the OHDSI/OMOP ecosystem. This involves aligning NPAT terms with broader health data standards to facilitate cross-disciplinary research and care.
* **Enhancing Semantic Depth with Metadata**: For each NPAT, include metadata that describes its development, validation, and application history. This includes information on the populations in which it has been validated, its sensitivity and specificity, and any adaptations that have been developed.

### Results
* **Landscape Analysis**:
Our investigation commenced with a thorough landscape analysis, scrutinizing standardized terminologies for neuropsychiatric assessment instruments embedded within the OHDSI Vocabularies. This exploration, bolstered by an operational blueprint, aimed to bridge identified gaps in the existing landscape. Employing a tripartite strategy, we devised a conceptual model for NPAT storage and utilization within OMOP, conducted a hierarchical analysis of assessment tools to discern their relational dynamics, and refined concept mapping methodologies to elevate data interpretation precision and relevance.
* **Conceptual Model for NPAT Storage and Utilization**: In alignment with our overarching objectives, we developed a conceptual model for the storage and utilization of NPATs within the OMOP framework. This model delineates the structural framework for organizing NPATs, encompassing key elements such as data storage formats, terminology mapping strategies, and utilization protocols. By establishing a standardized conceptual framework, we aim to streamline data integration, retrieval, and analysis processes, thus facilitating seamless utilization of NPAT data within the OMOP ecosystem.
* **Hierarchical Gaps and Semantic Constructs**: The comprehensive evaluation of neuropsychiatric assessment tools necessitated a meticulous gap analysis, aimed at scrutinizing existing methodologies and identifying areas for improvement within the NPAT landscape. This analysis involved a systematic mapping of available tools against standardized frameworks, facilitating the identification of both mapped and unmapped instruments. By discerning the gaps in coverage and representation, this process provided critical insights into areas where existing assessments may fall short or where additional tools are required to address specific clinical or research needs. Within the OMOP framework, 324 Observable Entities serve as semantic parents for assessment instruments in OMOP. Our evaluation of hierarchical gaps within the Observable Entity semantic class revealed that 2,132 assessment instruments are within the Observable Entity hierarchy, whereas 3,013 are outside, indicating that roughly 41% of the tools are categorized within this hierarchy. Using data obtained from the Thesaurus of Psychological Index Terms and the Arab Psychology Scales, we defined 26 main hierarchical nodes representing key semantic constructs within the neuropsychiatric hierarchy, such as personality traits, intelligence, emotions, mental health disorders, interpersonal relationships etc. These constructs, along with their 306 unique sub-constructs, lay the foundation for our NPAT hierarchy. Enriching our data model's semantic depth and scope, we endeavored to forge connections between HPO terminology and mental health assessment tools. Our scrutiny unveiled 1,400 psychiatric terms under the high-level term HP:0011446, "Abnormality of Higher Mental Function", with 12.7% of child terms unmapped. Furthermore, we conducted a comprehensive gap analysis, juxtaposing the top 100 real-world assessment instruments against the OMOP Vocabularies. Our findings showcased that 86% were effectively mapped, propelling community contributions for future enhancements.
* **Item-Level Extension and Metadata Documentation**:
We also delved into the details of NPSS item-level extension by exploring 58 complex psychiatric scales, such as "Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs)" and the "Child and Adolescent Trauma Screen (CATS)", which together comprise a total of 290 defined questions (so-called items). 235 of these items currently lack mapping in OMOP, representing approximately 81% of the total. Our team identified and recorded metadata for various psychometric measurements. This documentation encompasses objectives (“the Beck Anxiety Inventory aims to evaluate the intensity of anxiety symptoms among adults and adolescents”), characteristics (e.g., “the scale is clinician-administered, spans 17 to 24 items based on the version, and measures depression severity”), reliability (Patient Health Questionnaire-9 with a Cronbach's alpha coefficient of 0.89), and interrelations (e.g., the connections between the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory and the Big Five Personality Test). Additionally, we developed and recorded methods for storing various types of assessment results, such as strings, ranges, integers, and floating values, within the OMOP CDM.

### Future Directions 
Moving forward, our initiative is poised to embark on several strategic initiatives aimed at advancing the field of neuropsychiatric assessment within the OHDSI/OMOP framework. These initiatives include:
* **Incorporating New Psychometric Scales**: Continuously expanding and enriching the repertoire of psychometric scales within the NPAT vocabulary. This involves the systematic inclusion of newly developed assessment tools that demonstrate robust psychometric properties and clinical utility.
* **Conducting Studies to Validate Methodologies**: Undertaking empirical studies to validate and refine methodologies employed in neuropsychiatric assessments. This involves conducting rigorous empirical investigations to assess the reliability, validity, and clinical utility of existing assessment tools within real-world clinical settings.
* **Enhancing Semantic Depth and Scope of the Data Model**: Continuously enhancing the semantic depth and scope of the NPAT data model to accommodate the intricacies of neuropsychiatric assessments. This entails refining existing data elements, developing standardized terminologies for emerging domains, and fostering interoperability with complementary data models and ontologies.
